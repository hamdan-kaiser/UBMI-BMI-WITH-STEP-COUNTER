# UBMI-BMI-WITH-STEP-COUNTER
 * Objectives: An app that calculates BMI,
 * keeps the history and keep track of your daily walking via connecting with a wristband.
 *
 * Project APIâ€™s:
 * 1.	Socket
 * 2.	Alter Dialog
 * 3.	Bluetooth Adapter
 * 4.	Bluetooth Socket
 * 5.	Dialog Interface
 * 6.	BroadcastReciever
 * 7.	InterFilter
 * 8.	RegisterReciver
 * 9.	createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord
 * 10.	Inflate
 * 11.	Hashmap
 *
 *
 * Bugs to fix:
 * 1.	For our projects, there were too little online reference because we are working both with the software and hardware.
 * 2.	It was a tough work to connect the Arduino with the app. It was easy to send data to Arduino but receiving data was too tough.
 * 3.	Another task was tough, that is the data coming from Arduino was on bytes,
 * the conversion bytes to string was a little bit tough.
